# Conceptual Design

The concept was inspired by Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrors exhibit, where the participant is inserted into the installation, and becomes a medium for the creation of art.
Isometric drawings were drafted of a model city containing 5 buildings, each with unique designs and electrical components, such as ultrasonic, touch, or motion sensors, and RGB LEDs. Human interaction with the installation effects changes in the box.
