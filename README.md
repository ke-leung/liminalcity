# Conceptual Design

Isometric drawings were drafted of a model city containing 5 buildings, each with unique designs and electrical components, such as ultrasonic, touch, or motion sensors, and RGB LEDs. Interaction with the buildings causes change throughout the installation, so that a person can give their own meaning to the piece.
